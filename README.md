# Project-xWord
Python project built with the Anvil platform. Primarily used to learn Anvil's API endpoint capabilities and getting to grips with the inner workings of the project to build a crossword cheater. App scrapes from a Google text file dictionary with a user submitted word as a filter. A list of potential solutions is returned based on the pattern submitted.

If you wish to use the dictionary file you can download it from my Google Drive using [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hq089AkUCvpotK9I4pckxUB99MLkAVip/view?usp=sharing). Once you have the file accessible to the Anvil platform via the available APIs (or your own method), just tie it into the import_dictionary function and you're all set!

If you'd like to import this to your own Anvil account and toy around with it feel free by using the link below:
